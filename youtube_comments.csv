I was hiding in the bathroom stall, so I

didn't see his face, but I heard him.
He was singing along to the music at the
bar.
Do you remember what he was singing?
I think it was that song, ""I Want It
That Way""
Backstreet Boys, I'm familiar. Okay...
Number One, can you please sing the
opening to ""I Want It That Way""?
Really? Okay.
You are my fire...
Number Two, keep it going...
The one desire...
Number Three...
Believe when I say...
Number Four...
I want it that way...
TELL ME WHY!
Ain't nothing but a heartache...

TELL ME WHY!
Ain't nothing but a mistake...
Now number five...

I never want to hear you say...
WOO!
I Want It That Way!

Ahh. Chills you guys.

Literal chills...
It was number five. Number five
killed my brother!
Oh my god, I forgot about that part!

Since the witness was connected to the victim she’s very likely to want to find the culprit, and since she’s been given 5 people to ‘choose from’ she’ll likely choose one of them even if none of them actually committed the crime. Our sound memory isn’t actually that good, so he just might have a similar voice to the guy who killed his brother. I’d like to see how they made that line up and how they actually chose the suspects. 


PS yes I know this is a comedy and I loved the comedic value of this, I just have an exam on perception coming up and this just occurred to me as a good example of possible witness bias lol",True

@Standupibrahimbackup,2019-05-15T08:24:45Z,0,A very very subtle but the most important part of b99 is that everyone always act as per their character and not affected by the other character or situation. Like here the girl is unaffected how jake is being an a-hole and she's still crying over her brother's death. Throughout the series this trend has continued. Hitchcock and Skully are the best ones to do this. They always always always stay in their goofy and stupid characters. I just love this show. ❤️,True
